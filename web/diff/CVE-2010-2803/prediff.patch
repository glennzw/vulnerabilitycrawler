   drm: stop information leak of old kernel stack.
   
   non-critical issue, CVE-2010-2803
   
   Userspace controls the amount of memory to be allocate, so it can
   get the ioctl to allocate more memory than the kernel uses, and get
   access to kernel stack. This can only be done for processes authenticated
   to the X server for DRI access, and if the user has DRI access.
   
   Fix is to just memset the data to 0 if the user doesn't copy into
   it in the first place.
