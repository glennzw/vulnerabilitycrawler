+* Release v1.11.2
+    * Use wget --no-clobber to prevent TOCTTOU-based hole allowing a
+      well-informed attacker to rewrite arbitrary user files with images.
+      The attacker needs to know feh's PID and the URL the user gave it.
+      It is still possible for an attacker to _create_ arbitrary files via the
+      same hole.
