   Ensure keyboard grab and unlock dialog exist after monitor removal
   
   gnome-screensaver currently doesn't deal with monitors getting
   removed properly.  If the unlock dialog is on the removed monitor
   then the unlock dialog and its associated keyboard grab are not
   moved to an existing monitor when the monitor removal is processed.
   
   This means that users can gain access to the locked system by placing
   the mouse pointer on an external monitor and then disconnect the
   external monitor.
