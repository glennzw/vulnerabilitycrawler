   drivers/video/via/ioctl.c: prevent reading uninitialized stack memory
   
   The VIAFB_GET_INFO device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 246
   bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the "reserved" member of
   the viafb_ioctl_info struct declared on the stack is not altered or
   zeroed before being copied back to the user.  This patch takes care of
   it.
