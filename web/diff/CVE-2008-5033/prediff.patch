   security: avoid calling a NULL function pointer in drivers/video/tvaudio.c
   
   NULL function pointers are very bad security wise. This one got caught by
   kerneloops.org quite a few times, so it's happening in the field....
   
   Fix is simple, check the function pointer for NULL, like 6 other places
   in the same function are already doing.
