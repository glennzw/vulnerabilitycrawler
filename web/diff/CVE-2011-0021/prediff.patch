   Fix heap overflows in CDG decoder
   
   This patch resolves two heap corruption vulnerabilities in the CDG
   decoder for VLC media player.  In both cases, a failure to properly
   validate indexes into statically-sized arrays on the heap could allow a
   maliciously crafted CDG video to corrupt the heap in a controlled
   manner, potentially leading to code execution.
   
   The patch is against v1.1.5 from vlc git, but this decoder hasn't been
   touched in awhile, so I'd expect it to cleanly apply to older versions.
   I've tested it and confirmed it resolves the heap corruption issues and
   does not break functionality.
