   [SCSI] megaraid_sas: remove sysfs dbg_lvl world writeable permissions
   
   /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl defaults to being
   world-writable, which seems bad (letting any user affect kernel driver
   behavior and logging level).
   
   This turns off group and user write permissions, so that on typical
   production systems only root can write to it.
