   USB: serial/mos*: prevent reading uninitialized stack memory
   
   The TIOCGICOUNT device ioctl in both mos7720.c and mos7840.c allows
   unprivileged users to read uninitialized stack memory, because the
   "reserved" member of the serial_icounter_struct struct declared on the
   stack is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user.
   This patch takes care of it.
