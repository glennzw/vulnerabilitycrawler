   [perl #87336] lc/uc(first) fail to taint the returned string
   
   This bug was caused by change 28011 (ec9af7d), which stopped pp_lc
   from using sv_setsv_flags, thereby bypassing these two lines at the
   end of that function:
       if (SvTAINTED(sstr))
   	SvTAINT(dstr);
   
   Change 28012 (6730619) did exactly the same thing to pp_uc.
   
   28013 (d54190f) broke ucfirst and lcfirst.
   
   This commit simply puts that taint logic at the end of the pp_*
   functions.
