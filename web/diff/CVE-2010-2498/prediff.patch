   Fix Savannah bug #30106.
   
   Point numbers for FreeType's implementation of hinting masks are
   collected before the final number of points of a glyph has been
   determined; in particular, the code for handling the `endchar'
   opcode can reduce the number of points.
   
   * src/pshinter/pshalgo.c (psh_glyph_find_strong_points): Assure that
   `end_point' is not larger than `glyph->num_points'.
