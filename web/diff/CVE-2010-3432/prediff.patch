   sctp: Do not reset the packet during sctp_packet_config().
   
   sctp_packet_config() is called when getting the packet ready
   for appending of chunks.  The function should not touch the
   current state, since it's possible to ping-pong between two
   transports when sending, and that can result packet corruption
   followed by skb overlfow crash.
