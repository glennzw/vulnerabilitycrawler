   Sanitize the URLs passed to redirect_to to prevent a potential response spli
   
   CGI.rb and mongrel don't do any sanitization of the contents of HTTP headers

    def redirect(to_url, response_status)
      self.headers["Status"] = response_status
      self.headers["Location"] = to_url

      self.body = "<html><body>You are being <a href=\"#{to_url}\">redirected</a>.</body></html>"
    end

    def prepare!
