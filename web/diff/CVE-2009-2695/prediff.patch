   Security: allow capable check to permit mmap or low vm space
   
   On a kernel with CONFIG_SECURITY but without an LSM which implements
   security_file_mmap it is impossible for an application to mmap addresses
   lower than mmap_min_addr.  Based on a suggestion from a developer in the
   openwall community this patch adds a check for CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  It is
   assumed that any process with this capability can harm the system a lot
   more easily than writing some stuff on the zero page and then trying to
   get the kernel to trip over itself.  It also means that programs like X
   on i686 which use vm86 emulation can work even with mmap_min_addr set.
