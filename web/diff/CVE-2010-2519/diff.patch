commit b2ea64bcc6c385a8e8318f9c759450a07df58b6d
Author: suzuki toshiya <mpsuzuki@hiroshima-u.ac.jp>
Date:   Fri Jul 2 18:16:02 2010 +0900

    Additional fix for Savannah bug #30306.
    
    * src/base/ftobjs.c (Mac_Read_POST_Resource): If the type
    of the POST fragment is 0, the segment is completely ignored.
    The declared length of the segment is not cared at all.
    According to Adobe Technical Note 5040, type 0 segment is
    comment only and should not be loaded for the interpreter.
    Reported by Robert Swiecki.
