   Additional fix for Savannah bug #30306.
   
   * src/base/ftobjs.c (Mac_Read_POST_Resource): If the type
   of the POST fragment is 0, the segment is completely ignored.
   The declared length of the segment is not cared at all.
   According to Adobe Technical Note 5040, type 0 segment is
   comment only and should not be loaded for the interpreter.
