   can: add missing socket check in can/raw release
   
   v2: added space after 'if' according code style.
   
   We can get here with a NULL socket argument passed from userspace,
   so we need to handle it accordingly.
   
   Thanks to Dave Jones pointing at this issue in net/can/bcm.c

static int raw_release(struct socket *sock)
{
	struct sock *sk = sock->sk;
	struct raw_sock *ro = raw_sk(sk);

	unregister_netdevice_notifier(&ro->notifier);
