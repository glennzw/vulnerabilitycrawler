   xfs: prevent reading uninitialized stack memory
   
   The XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 12
   bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the fsxattr struct
   declared on the stack in xfs_ioc_fsgetxattr() does not alter (or zero)
   the 12-byte fsx_pad member before copying it back to the user.  This
   patch takes care of it.
