   econet: 4 byte infoleak to the network
   
   struct aunhdr has 4 padding bytes between 'pad' and 'handle' fields on
   x86_64.  These bytes are not initialized in the variable 'ah' before
   sending 'ah' to the network.  This leads to 4 bytes kernel stack
   infoleak.
   
   This bug was introduced before the git epoch.
