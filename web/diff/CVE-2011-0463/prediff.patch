   Treat writes as new when holes span across page boundaries
   
   When a hole spans across page boundaries, the next write forces
   a read of the block. This could end up reading existing garbage
   data from the disk in ocfs2_map_page_blocks. This leads to
   non-zero holes. In order to avoid this, mark the writes as new
   when the holes span across page boundaries.
