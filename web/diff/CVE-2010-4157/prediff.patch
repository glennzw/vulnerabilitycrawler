   [SCSI] gdth: integer overflow in ioctl
   
   gdth_ioctl_alloc() takes the size variable as an int.
   copy_from_user() takes the size variable as an unsigned long.
   gen.data_len and gen.sense_len are unsigned longs.
   On x86_64 longs are 64 bit and ints are 32 bit.
   
   We could pass in a very large number and the allocation would truncate
   the size to 32 bits and allocate a small buffer.  Then when we do the
   copy_from_user(), it would result in a memory corruption.
